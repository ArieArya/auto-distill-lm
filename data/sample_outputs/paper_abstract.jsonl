Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.", "output": "dust, sN ejecta, todini ferrara model, ism, sn remnants, qso, stellar explosion, sputtering, stochastic heating, ir emission"}

Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques.

As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the\nantiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to\nanisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the\nisotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)\nanisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and\ntemperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.", "output": "xxz spin-chain, renormalization group theory, specific heats, spin correlations, heisenberg model, xy model, ising model, fermionic excitations, spinons, quantum effects, antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism"}

Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge.

[abridged] Relative to\nnonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities\nand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased\npolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on\nthe degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of\ndifferentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be\nshifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in\nluminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between\nM and about 0.7 M.

We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts.

We analyze correlations between these\ntwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string\nvacua, and find a number of striking features.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus\npredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity\nof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners\nare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate\ncores with envelopes.

In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP\nburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core\nmasses, and distances from the SMBH.

The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.", "output": "power spectrum, interstellar medium, diffused interstellar emission, cirrus noise, gaussian properties, statistical properties, stellar matter density, brightness fluctuations, spectral index, kurtosis, non-gaussianity, confusion noise, gaussian random fields, simulation, interstellar dust emission"}

The spots range in latitude\nfrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar\nvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well\nconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini.

The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with\nPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed\nfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation\ncurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured\nat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that\ncorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs\nbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15\nr_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with\nincreasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by\nthe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex\nand HI width measurements into a homogeneous system.

The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios.

Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant\nmodulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing\nto either stochastic or deterministic processes.

The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and\nassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully\ndeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for\nprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with\nparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target\ntimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to\npredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in\nall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even\nshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the\ninput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the\npredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and\nnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting\nthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.", "output": "mean-field models, solar cycle, stochastic processes, deterministic processes, solar dynamo models, predictability, long-term prediction, short-term prediction, input parameters, uncertainty, transport coefficients, nonlinear responses"}

We investigate how this ``macroclumping''\nimpacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodel atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for\nclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps\nreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent\nspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the\noptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV\nresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into\naccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and\nrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping\nmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:\nMass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line\nin O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping.

However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our\nFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one\nmay naively expect between the cluster parameters.

We then perform numerical calculations of helium-like\nX-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of Seyferts) and predict\nline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and column\ndensity. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the\n$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on the\nionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large column\ndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of the\nincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which is\ntemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown to\nbe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well.

In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of\nthe event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We\nnext investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the\ncompanion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into\naccount the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the\nphotoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves\nobserved at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.\nHowever, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much\nlarger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case\nthat the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be\ndifficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have\nthe realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number\ndensities for several elements.

We report about the results and the comparison of the spectrum above\n10 keV based on INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI, Swift/BAT, and BeppoSAX/PDS. A spectrum\ncan be extracted in the X-ray energy band ranging from 1 keV up to 200 keV.\nAlthough NGC 2992 shows a complex spectrum below 10 keV, the hard tail observed\nby various missions exhibits a slope with photon index = 2, independent on the\nflux level during the observation. No cut-off is detectable up to the detection\nlimit around 200 keV. In addition, NGC 3081 is detected in the INTEGRAL and\nSwift observation and also shows an unbroken Gamma = 1.8 spectrum up to 150\nkeV. These two Seyfert galaxies give further evidence that a high-energy\ncut-off in the hard X-ray spectra is often located at energies E_C >> 100 keV.\nIn NGC 2992 a constant spectral shape is observed over a hard X-ray luminosity\nvariation by a factor of 11. This might indicate that the physical conditions\nof the emitting hot plasma are constant, while the amount of plasma varies, due\nto long-term flaring activity.", "output": "seymour galaxies, integral ibis/isgri, swift/bat, bepposax/pds, x-ray energy, seyerft 2 galaxy, gamma ray astronomy, seyfert galaxy, plasma physics"}

Our approach is based\non the Landauer formalism and the Fisher-Lee relations, appropriately\ngeneralized to spin-orbit interaction, and a semiclassical representation of\nGreen functions. We calculate conductance coefficients by exploiting ergodicity\nand mixing of suitably combined classical spin-orbit dynamics, and making use\nof the Sieber-Richter method and its most recent extensions. That way we obtain\nweak anti-localization and confirm previous results obtained in the symplectic\nensemble of Random Matrix Theory.", "output": "spin-orbit interaction, ballistic transport, landauer formalism, fisher-lee relations, green functions, weak localization, random matrix theory"}
{"id": 996, "input": "AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to study\nsurface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\ndetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\nmantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than\na slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement\nwith observations.", "output": "microscopic monte carlo, surface chemistry, interstellar grains, gas phase, surface chemistry, reaction formalism, diffusion, oligovne, ab initio modeling, desorption"}
{"id": 997, "input": "Recent studies of the near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregular\ngalaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have provided improved estimates\nfor the NIR luminosity of old stellar populations in these galaxies. These can\nbe used to derive gas fractions, and thereby to evaluate how BCDs have evolved\nwith respect to dIs. Oxygen abundances have been derived for four BCDs in the\nVirgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these new\nabundances with published values, we study the correlations among the\nmetallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Within\nerrors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between the\noxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicity\nand the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD\nevolution has been similar to dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolated\nsystems, the BCD bursts are unlikely to be a consequence of gas infall or\nmerging.", "output": "near infrared properties, galaxy evolution, metallicity, gas mass, baryonic mass, oxygen abundance, k band luminosity, virgo cluster, gaseous dwarf galaxies, star formation"}
{"id": 998, "input": "I consider the question of the interaction between a QCD string and the spin\nof a quark or an antiquark on whose worldline the string terminates. The\nproblem is analysed from the point of view of a string representation for the\nexpectation value of a Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. A string\nrepresentation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective\nstring representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is\ninvariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which\ncontains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string\ninteraction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy\nquark potential. On the other hand if an allowance is made for the finite\nintrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, by assuming that the spin-string\ninteraction takes place not just at the boundary of the string world-sheet but\nextends to a distance of the order of the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube,\nthen we do obtain a spin-spin interaction which falls as the fifth power of the\ndistance. Such a term was previously suggested by Kogut and Parisi in the\ncontext of a flux-tube model of confinement.", "output": "qcd, wilson loop, spin half particle, supersymmetry, spin-string interaction, heavy quark potential, kogut-parisi model"}
{"id": 999, "input": "The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole are nearly Keplerian\nellipses. Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an\nenhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under\ncertain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution\nand affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more\nefficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the\ncluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate\nthis dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function\nof eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that\nchanges the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to\neccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits\nthan on circular orbits.", "output": "keplerian ellipses, angualr momentum relaxation, resonant relaxation, keplerian orbits, eccentricty"}
