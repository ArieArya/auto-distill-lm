{"id": 1, "input": "The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission."}

The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other!

Gas and dust\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\nstrongly evolved.

The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift."}

The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages.

There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy.

{"id": 74, "input": "We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN)\nmechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a\nflavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found\nthat at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry\nare necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative\nphase between their vacuum expectation values.\n  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are\ndetermined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation\nvalues R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase).

A large part of this review provides however general\ninformation applicable to any kind of solid-state laser.

After a presentation of some general properties of\nYb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in\nYb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the\nfirst step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).\nWe will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the\nthermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of\nthermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context\nwhere it is not relevant.

{"id": 77, "input": "We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field\ndiffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.\nThe Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude\ndependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is\nshown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent\nto replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic\nexpression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well\nthe asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient\nsurface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this\nmodel and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient\n\"near-zone\" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,\nit is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes\nthe asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient\nnear-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and\noptimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part\nwill be controlled by surface waves."}
{"id": 78, "input": "The first-order eikonal approximation is frequently adopted in interpreting\nthe results of $A(e,e'p)$ measurements.

We present an extension\nof the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts for\nsecond-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performed\nwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear\ntransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal\ncorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \\approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same\napplies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential\ncross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, the\nsecond-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in\ncloser agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting\npartial-wave expansions."}
{"id": 79, "input": "We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant\n(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)\nonboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four\nobserved IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,\noptical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative\nSNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared\nwaveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the\ninfrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible\ncontributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged\nSNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443.

A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine\nthe effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such\npolymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with\nthe effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme\nblockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a\npolymer-polymer demixing transition.

{"id": 90, "input": "We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a\npoint mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This\nsuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of\nthe orbit via the gravitational waves."}
{"id": 91, "input": "Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate."}

The propagators and the\nFaddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.\nIn addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are\ninvestigated systematically.

We derive the electrical and energy currents of\nthe coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an\napplication, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions\nwithin the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current\nconservation.

{"id": 95, "input": "When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is\nrotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the\ntransmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by\nextending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We\nfind that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating\nmedium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular\nmomentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum\naccount respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of\nthe transmitted image."}

These black holes are\nstationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes and\nfind that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compact\ndirection is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADM\ntension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always\npositive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also\nderive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,\nand a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in\nthe compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived by\nTraschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem\nrelation and give its extension in the stationary, non-rotating case."}

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al.

{"id": 112, "input": "A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths."}

This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model.

These morphological classifications are compared to\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\ngalaxies in the early-type population.

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable.

Although closure dynamics introduce\nstatistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant\ncomputational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and\nmay be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can\nin principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including\nstrongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there\nmay be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for\nimplementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic\npartial differential equation."}
{"id": 143, "input": "It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on\nopportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in\ndense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ\ntransmission approach where relays forward parity information to the\ndestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,\nsuffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the\nbest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by\nadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection\nproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is\nnecessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying\nkey parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold\nis discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the\nimportance of relay selection."}
{"id": 144, "input": "This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole\nmagnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux\ndominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the\nergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified\nlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the\nergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for\ngreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux\nthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of\nelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux\nthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading\nthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central\nengine of powerful FRII quasars."}

The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels.

NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center.

Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral.

Finally, we\ndiscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject\nto external magnetic fields.

{"id": 182, "input": "Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI."}

The \"weak\" bimodality is\nobservationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR,\nwhile the \"strong\" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quiet\nearly-type galaxies.

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\nrelativistic electrons.\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength.

In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions.

There is also a host of significant correlations\nbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the\noptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group\nhierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be\naccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy\nluminosity or mass.

{"id": 224, "input": "Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger.

The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\nunique case study for blazar activity.

Under certain restrictions on the\ninitial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted\nentangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local\nancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct\nSchmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large\nmultiplicity).

{"id": 251, "input": "To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for\nplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the\nprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the\nlensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\nincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of\nevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even\nat magnifications as low as $A\\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\nevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the\nbrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain\nmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\\lesssim\n10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars\nwith magnifications $A\\gtrsim 70$."}

{"id": 253, "input": "Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng/cm^2).

{"id": 261, "input": "There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising."}

{"id": 279, "input": "Motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on\nLa-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin\nsusceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40\nmeV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the\nincommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases\ndramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and\nthe IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,\nnamely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the\nsuperconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The\nspectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)\nwhile it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at\nthe frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and\nlocal maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the\nFermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the\nspin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of\nLa-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for\nY-based and La-based cuprates."}

{"id": 315, "input": "We discuss the fixed-point Hamiltonian and the spectrum of excitations of a\nquasi-bidimensional electronic system supporting simultaneously\nantiferromamagnetic ordering and superconductivity. The coexistence of these\ntwo order parameters in a single phase is possible because the magnetic order\nis linked to the formation of a spin density wave, and its order parameter is\nnot associated to a spectral gap but to an energy shift of the paramagnetic\nbands. This peculiarity entails several distinct features in the phase diagram\nand the spectral properties of the model, which may have been observed in\nCeRhIn$_5$. Apart from the coexistence, we find an abrupt suppression of the\nspin density wave when the superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures\nare equal.

{"id": 316, "input": "The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is\nanalysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the\nrenormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the\ncouplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the\nspace of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large\nvariety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points\nincludes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field\ntheories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed\npoints. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are\nconformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions\nare infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary\nconditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes\nwe analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the\nrenormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy\nevolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does\nnot affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in\none-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories."}

The\nmain assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the\ncoronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun\nfrom the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are\nsensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.\nHowever, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The\ncalculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a\nlesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed\nones for most of the considered density models.

HS\n0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)\nh. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS\n0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital\nperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed\nphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic\nbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new\nadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent\nof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the\nrequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the\nmodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,\nthe predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming\nmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period\ninterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by\nour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the\nHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital\nperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close\nto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the\nstandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the\nhighest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of\ncommon properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit."}
{"id": 350, "input": "Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources\nobserved by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio\npulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray\nobservations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for\nthe number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens\nto many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this\nrange, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a\npointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be\nconducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and\nstatistics scale with various parameters."}

We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the\ndirection of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of\nindicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried\nout. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC\nshowed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We\nsimulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for\nRBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,\nthe disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two\norientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence.

{"id": 355, "input": "A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced\nand discussed, which enhances loop quantum cosmology by relevant features seen\nin inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which\nis being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads\nto a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant\nstep-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models\ncan be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.\nTwo detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong\nconstraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental\nHamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large\nclass of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this\ncontext, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of\nmetric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently\nin more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were\nartificially suppressed."}

In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage\nregression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the\nsecond stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use\nhypothesis testing to eliminate some variables.

{"id": 358, "input": "It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods\nthe stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this\neffect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper\nwe first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this\nparticular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting\nthe usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations\nfrozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We\npresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected\nwith the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry\nby comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes\n(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results\nbased on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure\ndensity--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of\ndifferent sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a\nlinear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod\naspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of\nlarge values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast\nto Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$."}
{"id": 359, "input": "In this article we analyze the impact of B-physics and Higgs physics at LEP\non standard and non-standard Higgs bosons searches at the Tevatron and the LHC,\nwithin the framework of minimal flavor violating supersymmetric models. The\nB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of\nthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on\nthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe\nfor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the\nnon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary\nthese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the\nHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of\nnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available\nATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search\nchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter\nspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider\nsensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it\nmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small\nor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter."}

{"id": 362, "input": "We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs\nphase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are\nmeta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.\nThey decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all\nincident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the\nplasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose\nmultiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of\nE. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by\nthe plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross\nproperties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of\nfundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the\nplasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black\n(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which\nimplies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT\nduality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we\nconjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity."}
{"id": 363, "input": "We analyze several aspects of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in\nreaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's\nframework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to\nextended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar\nmodel, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show\nhow system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and\nthen how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further\nenhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less\ntrivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After\ndiscussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from\nit -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective\nscalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by\nthe range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we\nfind an optimal range that maximizes the system's response."}
{"id": 364, "input": "When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,\nthe leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of\nthe pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave\ndistortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in\nnumerical simulations."}

{"id": 367, "input": "We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),\nreaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for\ntwelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between\n~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different\nparts of the SMC such as the \"Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In\nthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields\nthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We\nfind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of\nboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show\nstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in\nthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the\neastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star\nformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the\nwestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF\nanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these\nparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in\nthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern\nfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the\nCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred\nfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are\ndominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack\nof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate\nthat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed\nfields."}

The scale invariance of the spectrum is\nrealized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability\ndrives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old\nekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition\nfrom the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse\nautomatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling\nsolution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The\nfinal amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the\nHubble scale at the transition."}

For the case of initial-state\ngluon radiation, we show that at the leading power in q_perp/P_perp and at the\nlowest non-trivial perturbative order, the dependence of Delta sigma(S_perp) on\nq_perp decouples from that on P_perp, so that the cross section can be\nfactorized into a hard part that is a function only of the single scale P_perp,\nand into perturbatively generated transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton\ndistributions with transverse momenta k_perp = O(q_perp)."}
{"id": 370, "input": "I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing\nby gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing\nrequire energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black\nhole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region.

Once\nthe hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:\nthe existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the\nPlanck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound\non the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section\nI discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information\nin the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe\nare determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes.

Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown that\nwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of\nself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it.

Eighteen remnant\ncandidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These\ndata provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for\ncharacterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into\naccount. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural\nproperties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to\ntest for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical\ncomparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)\nto obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index\nof isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective\ncomparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields.

The relative age and metallicity\nsensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,\nH, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for\nbreaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty\nparameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be\nused to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be\nvery useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In\ndetail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best\npairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two\nstellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89\nGyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties\nin colours.

{"id": 411, "input": "Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low\norbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars\nreceived only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case\nof the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars\nreceived hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of\nthe second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double\nneutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued\nthat these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture\ncollapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than\nabout 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars\nwere formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass.

{"id": 414, "input": "In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central\nblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the\nstrength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26\nunresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other\nones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects\nshowing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral\nindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of\nClass I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0\nsources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources\nlocated inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous\nobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,\ntestifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.\nThe presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,\nthe statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,\neven in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems\nto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any\nproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations."}

This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring\nmonotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\\gamma_L, \\gamma_S$ and\n$\\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\\delta =\n\\braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity\nbound.

The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite\ndifferent between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger\nparticle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of\npartial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional\nvariance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the\nfluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles.

Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and\nseveral H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the\nnear-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission\nthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.\nThe 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the\nspectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be\ncircumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the\noxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the\npreviously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line\nprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer\nnear the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and\nthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar\nand M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity\nof $\\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar\nabundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance\nwinnowing.

In this\ncase, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a\ncrystal with the special structure of La_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4, vanishes identically.\nWe propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the\nlayers recently observed in transport measurements at x=1/8."}

In contrast, the inverse magnetocaloric\neffect associated with the martensitic transition results in the unusual\ndecrease of temperature by adiabatic magnetization. We also provide\nmagnetization and specific heat data which enable to compare the measured\ntemperature changes to the values indirectly computed from thermodynamic\nrelationships. Good agreement is obtained for the conventional effect at the\nsecond-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. However, at the first\norder structural transition the measured values at high fields are lower than\nthe computed ones.

The optical photometry was\ncalibrated through the S-correction technique.\n  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble\nthose of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)\nmag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988\n(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of\nstandard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three\nmethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance\nmodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR\nbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies\nthat M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.\nModeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the\nrange 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and\nNIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II\nratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the\nblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum\nspectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K\ndoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the\ntime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia\nand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in\nmany SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components."}

We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards\n17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all\nsources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases.

Seven sources show both SiO detections\n(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance\nof H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources\nfor which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect\nto current theories of massive star formation via accretion.

The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia.

{"id": 448, "input": "The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in\nnature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy\ncutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating\noperators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard\nModel introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,\nquantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating\nthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum\ngravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation\nfor the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge\nsymmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,\nsuch a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed\nneutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the\nelectroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These\nrequirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a\nU(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of\nleft-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.\nThe existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future\nexperiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton\ndecay mediation.

Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state.

The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of\nthe self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure\nfor a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to\nnonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities\nand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased\npolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on\nthe degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of\ndifferentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be\nshifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in\nluminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between\nM and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,\nincluding (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the\nproperties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a\nreduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the\nnuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers\nbeneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like\noscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some\n1.5-2 M_sun stars."}

{"id": 457, "input": "During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is\ntransported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks\nafter the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well\ndescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s\nand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and\nafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)\nand alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively.

If found, such stars would provide evidence for the\nexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its\ndensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP\nburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core\nmasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the\nobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be\nconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We\nalso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of\ngamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark\nmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the\nEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision\nmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter\nspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent\nlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center."}
{"id": 488, "input": "We investigate the properties and evolution of accretion tori formed after\nthe coalescence of two compact objects. At these extreme densities and\ntemperatures, the accreting torus is cooled mainly by neutrino emission\nproduced primarily by electron and positron capture on nucleons (beta\nreactions). We solve for the disc structure and its time evolution by\nintroducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes\nphotodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino\nopacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas\nconsisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and\ncompute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron\nfraction throughout the disc.

{"id": 490, "input": "Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of high\nenergy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and\nderive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the\nprompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared\nwithin different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high\nenergy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock\nenergy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).\nFor very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be\ncomparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.\nHowever, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required\nto account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs\nare therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk\nLorentz factor (e.g. $\\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\\sim 10$ GeV are\nattenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even\nhigher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -\nPeV due to $\\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux\nlevel is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these\nphotons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons."}

An important feature of the present study is the\nconsistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert\ntheorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the\napplication of the $\\chi$EFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction\nproduces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the\nhigh-energy tail of the cross section.

A comparison between the resummation and the\nNext-to-Leading order (NLO) calculation is performed after imposing various\nkinematics cuts suggested in the literature for the Higgs boson search. For the\n$H\\to ZZ$ mode, the resummation effects increase the acceptance of the signal\nevents by about 25%, as compared to the NLO prediction, and dramatically alter\nvarious kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\\to WW$\nmode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummation\nand NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematical\ndistributions are quite different.

{"id": 504, "input": "We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural\nand astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is\ndefinitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,\nit does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow\nfor simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was\nobtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical\nevolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were\ndetermined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and\ndistances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass\nfunction was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation\neffect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study\nreports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42\nobserved open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed\nclusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.\nThe core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is\n3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's\nmass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical\nevolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is\nsimilar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of\nevaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass\nsegregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the\ndynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.\nLow-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5\nand not younger than one relaxation time."}

{"id": 511, "input": "We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatial\nresolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than\n10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared\nadaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles\ntypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is\nunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the\nnuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -\nstarbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few\npercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the\nluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a\nsimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to\n10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density\nexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited\nand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in\nmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset\nof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether\nthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in\nfuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and\nsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.\nOn the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,\nand they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds."}

{"id": 531, "input": "The attractor mechanism implies that the supersymmetric black hole near\nhorizon solution is defined only in terms of the conserved charges and is\ntherefore independent of asymptotic moduli. Starting only with the near horizon\ngeometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme\nblack hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are\ndefined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional\nEuclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the\nblack hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the\nentropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero\ntemperature.

By using the time-like gluon density\n(or scalar gluon density) as an independent degree of freedom - instead of the\ntemperature $T$ as a Lagrange parameter - variations of the potential energy\ndensity lead to effective mean-fields for time-like gluons and an effective\ngluon-gluon interaction strength at low density.

In order to study this point, we\nhave prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4}$\nusing the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with a\nbetter cation distribution.

For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic\nproperties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two\nkinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large\nmanifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects\nself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the\noriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the\ndependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter\nkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical\ncalculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase\ndiagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a\ndecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We\ncorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various\nphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined\nby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin\nperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model\nleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the\nground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,\nwhich is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition."}

The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations\nusing exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner\nordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger\nliquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it\noverestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal.

{"id": 559, "input": "In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field.

G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al.\nto contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4\nsolar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster\ncenter with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1\nis a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary\nin the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion\nonto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible\ncandidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity\nVLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If\nthe radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur\nfor hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,\nthey are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the\nExpanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010."}

{"id": 571, "input": "We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way\nquantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly\nimperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits,\nrequiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli\nerror, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce\nlocal resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of\npurification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a\nbiased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more\nrapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented\nof how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a\nsingle Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\\sim 10$ times the\nimperfection in local operations."}

{"id": 573, "input": "We point out some pitfalls related to the concept of an oracle property as\nused in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known\npitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a\nconsequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying\na sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss\nfunction; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the\nloss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the\nframework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that\nsetting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in\nfinite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator\nintroduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather\npoorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to\nmaximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator\nis tuned to sparsity."}

When the fluid is confined between two hard\nwalls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.\nFor higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even\nfor very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model\nused was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure\nFunctional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation\napproximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked\nexperimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical\nmotions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between\nthe grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which\nentropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface\nphenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids."}

In their smectic phases, fan-shaped and toric textures, sometimes\nwith periodic instability, are observed. Moreover, the nematic phase displays a\ntexture transition. Texture transitions have been previously observed only\ninside the nematic phase of some compounds belonging to the families of the\noxybenzoic and cyclohexane acids. In these two oxadiazole compounds we can\nobserve what we define as a \"toric nematic phase\", heating the samples from the\nsmectic phase.

{"id": 583, "input": "The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral\ncurrent (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of\nphysics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor\nviolation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top\nFCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We\nstudy these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy\neffective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the\nmost important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current\nconstraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level\nobservable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first\nor second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for\ntop decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC\ntop decays are observed at the LHC, such an analysis may help decipher the\nunderlying physics."}

Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and\nintegrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio,\ntotal infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images\nindicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the\ncentral regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks\nof Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.\nThe dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that\nvaries significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is\nco-spatial with H\\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC\n6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},\nsupport previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor\ncompared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately\n1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations\nare the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects.

In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be\nconcentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby\nopen clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.\nStronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive\nstars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found\nfor any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic\nflux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An\nexcess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and\nlower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the\ndistribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become\nobservable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main\nsequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg\nor 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be\nsomewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for\nan increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M\n> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun.

{"id": 606, "input": "The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded\nstocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this\npaper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that\nemerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets."}

The aims are (i) to assess how well\ncurrent models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the\nabundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes\naffect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.\n  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down\nto about 3400K.

{"id": 613, "input": "In this paper we continue to pursue a goal of finding an effective theory for\nhigh energy interaction in QCD based on the colour dipole approach, for which\nthe BFKL Pomeron Calculus gives a low energy limit. The key problem, that we\ntry to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL\nPomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :\n(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic\ninterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a\nHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the\nsecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather\ncomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be\nreduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space\nif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the\ntransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of\nLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one\nintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL\nPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$\nof Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two\nprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into\none dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to\nsimplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and/or to apply the\nprobabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these\napproaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models."}

{"id": 626, "input": "Based on our sample of 10095 galaxies with bulge-disc decompositions we\nderive the empirical B-band internal attenuation--inclination relation for\ngalaxy discs and their associated central bulges.

Depending on inclination, the B-band\nattenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6\nmag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photons\nproduced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that\nrises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dust\nextinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in all\noptical studies of large galaxy samples. This is particularly pertinent for\noptical HST comparative evolutionary studies as the dust properties will also\nbe evolving. We use the new results to revise our recent estimates of the\nspheroid and disc luminosity functions.

Our analysis covers cases\nwhere the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly\nnon-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,\nthe central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and\nlog-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very\nspecific manner.\n  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold\nunder the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm\nis theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is\nstudied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm\nin large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter\ndimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading\ncases after the burn-in period.

The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission."}

The coarse-scale calibration sample\nincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, on\nbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. The\ncoarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) and\nis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70\nmicron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,\nrespectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from two\nstars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all time\nscales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +/- 294\nMJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty in\nthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%\nphotometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,\n500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy. This work shows\nthat the MIPS 70 micron array produces accurate, well calibrated photometry and\nvalidates the MIPS 70 micron operating strategy, especially the use of frequent\nstimulator flashes to track the changing responsivities of the Ge:Ga detectors."}

A new locally-constrained\ndensity-functional theory approach gave access to the corresponding\npotential-energy surface (PES) seen by such an impinging spin-triplet molecule\nand indicated barriers to dissociation which reduce the sticking probability.\nHere, we further substantiate this non-adiabatic picture by providing a\ndetailed account of the employed approach. Building on the previous work, we\nfocus in particular on inaccuracies in present-day exchange-correlation\nfunctionals. Our analysis shows that small quantitative differences in the\nspin-triplet constrained PES obtained with different gradient-corrected\nfunctionals have a noticeable effect on the lowest kinetic energy part of the\nresulting sticking curve."}

The spots range in latitude\nfrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar\nvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well\nconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini.

{"id": 678, "input": "Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or\nlong-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between\nvarious estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are\nconsidered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated\nwith rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface\nbrightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with\nPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed\nfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation\ncurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured\nat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that\ncorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs\nbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15\nr_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with\nincreasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by\nthe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex\nand HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single\nrobust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk\nscaling relations."}

{"id": 695, "input": "Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single\nquantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different\nin their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak\ngauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions\nfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standard\nmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &\nEnglert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum\nstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual\nphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the\nsuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,\nconfers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to\nmasses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good\nstory--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is\ntrue. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)\nduring the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and\nmay uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion of\nthe electroweak theory.

{"id": 696, "input": "This paper focuses on supergravity duals of BPS states in N=4 super\nYang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of\nbreathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,\nand finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry\nanalysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in\nthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which\nhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are\ndetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.\nSimilarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a\nfour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,\nMonge-Ampere type equation.\n  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS\ndescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which\nensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle\nshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional\nbase. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a\nsmooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the\nbase. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an\nS^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including\ntopology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from the\nbase. In the case of 1/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularity\nconditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional\nbase which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from those\nwhere the S^1 shrinks."}

{"id": 698, "input": "GRB 060614 is a remarkable GRB observed by Swift with puzzling properties,\nwhich challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however\ndistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.\nConsidering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent\nwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations."}

The LBGs without Ly-alpha emission\nform a filamentary structure including the QSO, while the LAEs are distributed\naround the QSO but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. On the other hand, we\nserendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration of\nLBGs and LAEs where no strongly UV ionizing source such as a QSO or radio\ngalaxy is known to exist. In this cluster field, two populations are spatially\ncross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs to\nLBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields. We also found\na weak trend showing that the number counts based on Ly-alpha and UV continuum\nfluxes of LAEs in the QSO field are slightly lower than in the cluster field,\nwhereas the number counts of LBGs are almost consistent with each other. The\nLAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background\nradiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The\nclustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due\nto either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having\ncaused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the\nstrong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass\ngalaxies like LAEs."}

Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters,\nand we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attribute\nto anything other than reionization. Our results motivate looking for the\nsignature of reionization in existing LAE data.

If the clustering signature of reionization is detected in a LAE\nsurvey, a comparison with a Lyman-break or a H-alpha survey in the same field\nwould confirm the reionization hypothesis.

{"id": 709, "input": "We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN\nbased on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an LBV-like\noutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a\nconsequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief\nepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced\nX-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this\nobject was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most\npeculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment\ncreated by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN."}

There are now 30\nJupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in\nthis paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that\ndebris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to\norbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior\nto observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically\nmm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than\nthis. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and\nthe median mass loss rate is 2 kg/s.

This refutes\nprevious claims of large timing irregularities in these data. In the dipole\nspin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies an\nenergy loss rate < 1.5E32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 3.5E11\nG, and characteristic age tau > 24 Myr.

The X-ray luminosity of 1E 1207.4-5209, L(bol) ~= 2E33 ergs/s at 2 kpc,\nexceeds its spin-down energy loss, implying that L(bol) derives from residual\ncooling, and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris.

{"id": 715, "input": "In this work, the critical role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy\ncapacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper."}

It is found that spatial variations\nof the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which\nmay appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of\nequal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled\nstate, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the\nentanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the\natoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode.

{"id": 725, "input": "The energy density of the universe today may be dominated by the vacuum\nenergy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory.

We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action\ndisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale\ninvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in\nclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and\nleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with\nthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar\nfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry\nmodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass\nfor the vector field. We also show that a cosmologically broken pseudo-scale\ninvariance can generate a wide range of masses."}

Compact disk emission of hot (T>~500K) gas is observed\nthrough the H_2 0-0 S(2) and/or S(3) lines toward ~8% of our sources. The line\nfluxes are, however, higher by more than an order of magnitude than those\npredicted by recent disk models, even when X-ray and excess UV radiation are\nincluded. Similarly the [Ne II]/H_2 0-0 S(2) ratios for these sources are lower\nthan predicted, consistent with the presence of an additional hot molecular gas\ncomponent not included in current disk models. Oblique shocks of stellar winds\ninteracting with the disk can explain many aspects of the hot gas emission, but\nare inconsistent with the non-detection of [S I] and [Fe II] lines."}

The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and\nassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully\ndeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for\nprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with\nparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target\ntimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to\npredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in\nall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even\nshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the\ninput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the\npredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and\nnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting\nthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible."}

Our aim is not just to provide a functional\nfor a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of\nfundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities\nwith the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations of\nthree particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.\nThese configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure\nfunctionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This\nfailure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low\ndensity limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive\nthe functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The\ncorrect dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to\nfollow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not\nhave lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard\nhexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the\none for hard disks.

{"id": 793, "input": "Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate\nstellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss\ndeterminations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of\nstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically\nthin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical\nmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be\noptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''\nimpacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodel atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for\nclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps\nreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent\nspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the\noptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV\nresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into\naccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and\nrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping\nmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:\nMass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line\nin O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically\nthick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,\nneglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating\nempirical mass-loss rates."}

{"id": 808, "input": "Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most\npromising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost.

It is possible, even likely, that\nterrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;\nconsequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an important\nconsideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer\n(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar\nNeighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate\npotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from\nthe Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis\nshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit\nwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from\n-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.\nSupplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a\ncomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is\nbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the\nGalactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary\ncompanions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions\nwithin 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that\nthose systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs.

Our method,\nwhich involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside an\noptical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangements\nbeing used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration\nprovides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents\nbistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping,\nand also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the\nisolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed\nmostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are\nexpected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror\ncloser to completion."}
{"id": 818, "input": "I show that several observable properties of bursting neutron stars in metric\ntheories of gravity can be calculated using only conservation laws, Killing\nsymmetries, and the Einstein equivalence principle, without requiring the\nvalidity of the general relativistic field equations. I calculate, in\nparticular, the gravitational redshift of a surface atomic line, the touchdown\nluminosity of a radius-expansion burst, which is believed to be equal to the\nEddington critical luminosity, and the apparent surface area of a neutron star\nas measured during the cooling tails of bursts. I show that, for a general\nmetric theory of gravity, the apparent surface area of a neutron star depends\non the coordinate radius of the stellar surface and on its gravitational\nredshift in the exact same way as in general relativity. On the other hand, the\nEddington critical luminosity depends also on an additional parameter that\nmeasures the degree to which the general relativistic field equations are\nsatisfied. These results can be used in conjunction with current and future\nhigh-energy observations of bursting neutron stars to test general relativity\nin the strong-field regime."}

At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which\nthe condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton\nformation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the\ncondensate is seen again."}

In this work, we first assume that the power of the additive\nnoise is known and we find the optimum linear approximation of LLRs in the\nsense of maximum achievable transmission rate on the channel. The maximum\nachievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to the\nmaximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation. We also observe that this\nmethod appears to be the optimum in the sense of bit error rate performance\ntoo.

Whether these transcription factors\nlocate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of\nspeculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the\nprotein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this\npaper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering\na very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of\nlow affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,\ncorresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.\nWe study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes\nby considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks\nalong the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and\nthen re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and\na hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then\nre-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final\nprobability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can\nlocate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time\ndiffusing freely in the solution.

Stellar mass estimates from evolutionary models indicate that\nall of these stars were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to\n1.85 Msun.

All 9 planets\norbit at distances a \\geq 0.78 AU, which is significantly different than the\nsemimajor axis distribution of planets around lower-mass stars. We examine the\npossibility that the observed lack of close-in planets is due to engulfment by\ntheir expanding host stars, but we find that this explanation is inadequate\ngiven the relatively small stellar radii of K giants (Rstar < 32 Rsun = 0.15\nAU) and subgiants (Rstar < 7 Rsun = 0.03 AU).

We examine its nature and\nsurroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy\nvelocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray\nspectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is\ncomposed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity\ndispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other\nstructures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density\nmap, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound\nand associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric\nX-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in\nagreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate\nredshift (z~0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from\nweak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model\nassumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the\nX-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii)\nthe intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an\nover-estimation of the weak-lensing mass.

The circumburst medium is composed of a\nrealistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,\nfollowed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:\nWe followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including\nthe extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its\ndeceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind\ntermination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used\nthe adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution\nof the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to\nultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally\nstructured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic\nshell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh.

If a significant number of\nblack holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects\nrapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the\nscattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black\nholes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component,\nresulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations.\nSignificant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at\nearly times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes,\nbut can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar\nevolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster."}

This indicates that both sources have hot and warm circumstellar dust,\nionized stellar winds, extended low-density ionized regions, and\nphoto-dissociated regions. It appears difficult to attribute the total optical\nextinction of both sources to the hot and warm dust components, which suggests\nthat there could be an otherwise observable colder dust component responsible\nfor the most of the optical extinction and silicate absorption features. The\nobserved mid-infrared spectra are similar to those from Luminous Blue\nVariables, indicating that the highly-obscured massive X-ray binaries may\nrepresent a previously unknown evolutionary phase of X-ray binaries with\nearly-type optical companions.

{"id": 878, "input": "We investigate the origin of the GRB 060912A, which has observational\nproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burst\nambiguous. Short duration GRBs (SGRBs) are thought to have typically lower\nenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populations\nof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the long\nduration bursts. However, it has become clear that duration alone is\ninsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,\nleading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. GRB\n060912A had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, low\nredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been the\nhost, which would favour it being a short-burst. However, our deep optical\nimaging and spectroscopy of the location of GRB 060912A using the VLT shows\nthat GRB 060912A more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy at\nz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst.

Experiments\nwith entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum\npredictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining\nrealism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction\nof 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and\nexperiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic\ntheories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.\nIn the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two\nentangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality\nproposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories.

We also produce realistic mock\nobservations to verify whether the results from hydrodynamic simulations can be\nconfirmed. We find that SZ profiles depend marginally on the modelled physical\nprocesses, while they exhibit a strong dependence on cluster mass. The central\nand total SZ emission strongly correlate with the cluster X-ray luminosity and\ntemperature. The logarithmic slopes of these scaling relations differ from the\nself-similar predictions by less than 0.2; the normalization of the relations\nis lower for simulations including radiative cooling.

Despite having\nsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright\nmagnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existing\nmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formation\ncalculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. The\nexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic\nvariance scatter for \\theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularly\nrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level\nof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in all\nthree catalogues we find w(\\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. At\nthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest\ndeterminations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering\nis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at all\nangles).

The models suggest a novel way of modelling the system\nby treating the outburst as a sudden increase then decrease in wind mass-loss\nrate and velocity. The differences between this wind model and previous\nPrimakoff-type simulations are described. A more complex structure, even in 1D,\nis revealed through the presence of both forward and reverse shocks, with a\nseparating contact discontinuity. The effects of radiative cooling are\ninvestigated and key outburst parameters such as mass-loss rate, ejecta\nvelocity and mass are varied. The shock velocities as a function of time are\ncompared to the ones derived in Paper I. We show how the manner in which the\nmatter is ejected controls the evolution of the shock and that for a\nwell-cooled remnant, the shock deceleration rate depends on the amount of\nenergy that is radiated away."}

{"id": 901, "input": "In the semi-classical treatment, i.e. in a classical black hole geometry,\nHawking quanta emerge from trans-Planckian configurations because of scale\ninvariance. There is indeed no scale to stop the blue-shifting effect\nencountered in the backward propagation towards the event horizon. On the\ncontrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected in\nthe semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could be\ndynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use a\nnon-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the number\nof matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leading\ncontribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and in\nthe first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlation\nfunction of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking this\ncorrelator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distance\nfrom the horizon $\\propto G\\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.\n($G$ is Newton's constant and $\\kappa$ the surface gravity.)

{"id": 902, "input": "We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with\ndistance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is\nmotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization\nproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on\nnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also\nconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the\nnetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for\nthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite\nnetworks.

{"id": 903, "input": "In a previous work (M. Campisi. Stud. Hist. Phil. M. P. 36 (2005) 275-290) we\nhave addressed the mechanical foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics on the\nbasis of the Generalized Helmholtz Theorem. It was found that the volume\nentropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because it\nsatisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This property\nexplains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purely\nmechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger\nthan'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations\nwere considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)\nmechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the\nnatural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation\nvalue of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations\nperformed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be\nregarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss\nhow this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over\nprevious attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger values\nbecause the natural state of matter is at positive temperature. Actually the\nLaw of Entropy Decrease holds in artificially prepared negative temperature\nsystems."}
{"id": 904, "input": "It has been speculated that quantum gravity might induce a \"foamy\" space-time\nstructure at small scales, randomly perturbing the propagation phases of\nfree-streaming particles (such as kaons, neutrons, or neutrinos). Particle\ninterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\nto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\nthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\npropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\nexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of\ndecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by\nmeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard\n(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By\nassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain\n(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino\nmixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar nor\nKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whose\ncharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained. In the\n\"Lorentz-invariant\" case n=-1, we obtain the upper limit gamma_0<0.78 x 10^-26\nGeV at 95% C.L.

Through the use\nof an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear\npolarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue\nVariables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and\nfor which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model results\nindicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproduced\nfor two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,\noptically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.\nAlthough a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to\ndistinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given\nthe short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As the\npolarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipate\nthat all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetric\nvariability.

In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a)\nHaloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the\nother environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*,\nhalos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in\nsheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidly\nthan similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median\nspin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older in\nclusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane\nindependent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spin\nparallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it. For masses\nM>M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with\nthe filament or the sheet.

{"id": 927, "input": "In the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshift\ngalaxies with recent HST/ACS surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widely\nused fitting codes (GALFIT and GIM2D) for fitting single-component Sersic\nmodels to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. We find\nthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential\ndisks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,\nwhereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the\nlarge amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable\nfits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is\nabove that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly\nunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with\nsimulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for\nspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking\nout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this\nimportant systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding\nerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted\nfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields\nwith GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighbors\nbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions thereby\ndeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT's\nrobustness to nearby companions and factor of >~20 faster runtime speed are\nimportant advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets. Finally\nwe include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected in\nGEMS."}

The physical parameters that best represent the conditions\nwithin the molecular clouds in each of the galaxy types are estimated using a\nchi^2 analysis of several observed atomic fine structure and CO rotational\nlines. This analysis is explored over a wide range of density, radiation field,\nextinction, and other relevant parameters. Using these estimated physical\nconditions in methods that we have previously established, CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactors are then computed for CO transitions up to J=9-8. For the conventional\nCO(1-0) transition, the computed conversion factor varies significantly below\nand above the canonical value for the Milky Way in the four galaxy types\nconsidered.

We apply our method to the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe's (WMAP) Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data,\nexploring a seven dimensional space (tau, Omega_DE, Omega_M, omega_DM, omega_B,\nf_nu, n_s). We find two distinct regions-of-interest: the standard Concordance\nModel, and a region with large values of omega_DM, omega_B and H_0. This second\npeak in parameter space can be rejected by applying a constraint (or a prior)\non the allowable values of the Hubble constant. Our new technique uses a\nnon-parametric fit to the data, along with a frequentist approach and a smart\nsearch algorithm to map out a statistical confidence surface. The result is a\nconfidence ``ball'': a set of parameter values that contains the true value\nwith probability at least 1-alpha. Our algorithm performs a role similar to the\noften used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples from the posterior\nprobability function in order to provide Bayesian credible intervals on the\nparameters.

We have generated simulated light cones to match the resolution and\nsensitivity of current and future SZE instruments. Unlike many previous studies\nof this type, our simulation includes unbound gas, where an appreciable\nfraction of the baryons in the universe reside.\n  We have found that cluster line-of-sight overlap may be a significant issue\nin upcoming single-dish SZE surveys. Smaller beam surveys (~1 arcmin) have more\nthan one massive cluster within a beam diameter 5-10% of the time, and a larger\nbeam experiment like Planck has multiple clusters per beam 60% of the time. We\nexplore the contribution of unresolved halos and unbound gas to the SZE\nsignature at the maximum decrement. We find that there is a contribution from\ngas outside clusters of ~16% per object on average for upcoming surveys. This\nadds both bias and scatter to the deduced value of the integrated SZE, adding\ndifficulty in accurately calibrating a cluster Y-M relationship.\n  Finally, we find that in images where objects with M > 5x10^{13} M_{\\odot}\nhave had their SZE signatures removed, roughly a third of the total SZE flux\nstill remains.

Time-dependent numerical MHD simulations have proven to be\nespecially insightful, but one regime that remains difficult to simulate is\nwhen the energy scales (kinetic, thermal, magnetic) within the plasma become\ndisparate. We develop a numerical scheme that significantly improves the\naccuracy and robustness of the solution in this regime. We use a modified form\nof the WENO method to construct a finite-volume general relativistic\nhydrodynamics code called WHAM that converges at fifth order. We avoid (1)\nfield-by-field decomposition by adaptively reducing down to 2-point stencils\nnear discontinuities for a more accurate treatment of shocks, and (2) excessive\nreduction to low order stencils, as in the standard WENO formalism, by\nmaintaining high order accuracy in smooth monotonic flows. Our scheme performs\nthe proper surface integral of the fluxes, converts cell averaged conserved\nquantities to point conserved quantities before performing the reconstruction\nstep, and correctly averages all source terms.

{"id": 938, "input": "Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for\nfuture space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by\nlong-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive\nblack hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of\na short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent\ninterval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic\ncorrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a\ngeodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in\nthe waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are\nimportant depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic\nEMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately\nhalf of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections\ntend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a\nNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by\nparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular\nimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter\nestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black\nhole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such\ndephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive\nblack hole and obtain information about its spin."}

The connectedness\nof the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no\nwall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur.

We then perform numerical calculations of helium-like\nX-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of Seyferts) and predict\nline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and column\ndensity. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the\n$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on the\nionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large column\ndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of the\nincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which is\ntemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown to\nbe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well.

{"id": 960, "input": "We calculate eclipsing light curves for accretion flows around a rotating\nblack hole taking into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star.\nIn the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the\ninformation of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1\nkeV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black\nhole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on\nthe spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of\nthe event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We\nnext investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the\ncompanion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into\naccount the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the\nphotoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves\nobserved at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.\nHowever, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much\nlarger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case\nthat the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be\ndifficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have\nthe realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number\ndensities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries\ndue to the rotation of the accretion disc exist.

{"id": 962, "input": "In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically\ndistributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that\nthe collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this\ncondition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,\ni.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of\ntwo fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation\nscheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded\nbelow by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation\nscheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the\nuncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the\nnaked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two\nperfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,\nthe high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and\nconsequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation\nof the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid."}

The proposed mechanism converts trapped ultracold atoms of\ndifferent species into vibrationally excited molecules by a single microwave\ntransition and entirely depends on the existence of a permanent dipole moment\nin the molecules. As opposed to production of molecules by photoassociation or\nmagnetic-field Feshbach resonances our method does not rely on the structure\nand lifetime of excited states or existence of Feshbach resonances. In\naddition, we determine conditions for optimal creation of polar molecules in\nvibrationally excited states of the ground-state potential by changing\nfrequency and intensity of the microwave field. We also explore the possibility\nto produce vibrationally cold molecules by combining the microwave field with\nan optical Raman transition or by applying a microwave field to Feshbach\nmolecules.

The instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in\nthis network is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. Under\nan average power constraint at each source and the relay, the sum-rate for the\nachievable strategy of decode-and-forward (DF) is maximized over all power\nallocations (policies) at the sources and relay.

{"id": 972, "input": "A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a\ndelay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large."}

{"id": 987, "input": "The favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rapidly\nrotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.

Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur\npredominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the\nproblem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum\nremoval, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish\nto determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than\nGalactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear\nspectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample.

The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\ndetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\nmantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16.

The correlation between metallicity\nand the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD\nevolution has been similar to dIs.

A string\nrepresentation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective\nstring representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is\ninvariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which\ncontains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string\ninteraction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy\nquark potential.

Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an\nenhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under\ncertain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution\nand affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more\nefficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the\ncluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate\nthis dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function\nof eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that\nchanges the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to\neccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits\nthan on circular orbits."}
