{"id": 664, "input": "Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11th century onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, while at the same time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe."}
{"id": 665, "input": "Before the 12th century castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the Norman Conquest."}
{"id": 666, "input": "Their decoration emulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers."}
{"id": 667, "input": "Until the late 12th century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures)."}
{"id": 668, "input": "The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall."}
{"id": 669, "input": "It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture."}

{"id": 671, "input": "The castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design; late Roman coastal forts on the English \"Saxon Shore\" were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of \u00c1vila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091."}
{"id": 672, "input": "While castles were used to hold a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified."}
{"id": 673, "input": "Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences."}
{"id": 674, "input": "If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall."}
{"id": 675, "input": "For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure."}
{"id": 676, "input": "Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders."}

{"id": 680, "input": "French historian Fran\u00e7ois Gebelin wrote: \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy."}
{"id": 681, "input": "The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales."}

{"id": 685, "input": "Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations."}
{"id": 686, "input": "In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles."}
{"id": 687, "input": "While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon."}
{"id": 688, "input": "A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from."}
{"id": 689, "input": "The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon."}
{"id": 690, "input": "Among other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th century."}

{"id": 694, "input": "Revival or mock castles became popular as a manifestation of a Romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalry, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture."}
{"id": 695, "input": "This was because to be faithful to medieval design would have left the houses cold and dark by contemporary standards."}
{"id": 696, "input": "Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built."}
{"id": 697, "input": "A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce."}
{"id": 698, "input": "The cost of building a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material."}
{"id": 699, "input": "In the middle were castles such as Orford, which was built in the late 12th century for UK\u00a31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about UK\u00a37,000 between 1181 and 1191."}
{"id": 700, "input": "The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from UK\u00a31,000 to UK\u00a310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord's finances."}
{"id": 701, "input": "Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity."}
{"id": 702, "input": "Many countries had both timber and stone castles, however Denmark had few quarries and as a result most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick."}
{"id": 703, "input": "For example, when Tattershall Castle was built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick."}

{"id": 707, "input": "The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages."}
{"id": 708, "input": "This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet."}
{"id": 709, "input": "For instance many castles are located near Roman roads, which remained important transport routes in the Middle Ages, or could lead to the alteration or creation of new road systems in the area."}
{"id": 710, "input": "Urban castles were particularly important in controlling centres of population and production, especially with an invading force, for instance in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century the majority of royal castles were built in or near towns."}
{"id": 711, "input": "Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources."}
{"id": 712, "input": "Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain."}
{"id": 713, "input": "Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences."}
{"id": 714, "input": "They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site."}
{"id": 715, "input": "When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th and 12th centuries, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked with the creation of a castle."}
{"id": 716, "input": "This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, one of the most important institutions of medieval society."}
{"id": 717, "input": "Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining."}
{"id": 718, "input": "In 1403, a force of 37 archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\u0175r's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective."}
{"id": 719, "input": "Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted as a type of officer class."}
{"id": 720, "input": "It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites."}
{"id": 721, "input": "A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later."}

{"id": 723, "input": "A mine leading to the wall would be dug and once the target had been reached, the wooden supports preventing the tunnel from collapsing would be burned."}
{"id": 724, "input": "A counter-mine could be dug towards the besiegers' tunnel; assuming the two converged, this would result in underground hand-to-hand combat."}
{"id": 725, "input": "They were used to force open the castle gates, although they were sometimes used against walls with less effect."}
{"id": 726, "input": "A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry."}

{"id": 731, "input": "In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates."}
{"id": 732, "input": "The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect."}
{"id": 733, "input": "The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous."}
{"id": 734, "input": "In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's inferior status all the more glaring."}
