{"id": 144, "input": "The radio telescopes operated continuously at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres, which is an ideal wavelength for monitoring solar activity due to the Sun\u2019s particular chemical composition."}
{"id": 145, "input": "In 1966, an array consisting of 32 parabolic antennas, each 3 metres in diameter, was added to the observatory."}
{"id": 146, "input": "The goal was to refine the measurements from other radio telescopes by scanning the Sun\u2019s surface every noon at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres."}
{"id": 147, "input": "Operating at a wavelength of 2 centimetres, it was used to study galactic and extragalactic objects that emit radio waves, such as quasars."}

{"id": 149, "input": "The goal of the experiment was to discern a source of radio waves with great precision."}
{"id": 150, "input": "Very large antennas are necessary to precisely determine the position of radio sources because radio waves have much larger wavelengths than visible light waves, and because the detection of any object in space depends largely on the size of the observation instrument (that is, its lenses, mirrors or radio antennas)."}

{"id": 160, "input": "Fully operational in 1964, it consisted of 1,700 cedar posts that extended for 1.3 kilometres in the shape of a \"T\" to cover a surface area of 65,000 square metres."}
{"id": 161, "input": "The posts supported a network of several thousand metres of metallic wires formed the antenna of the radio telescope."}
{"id": 162, "input": "This radio telescope was primarily used between 1965 and 1969 during a period when solar spots were at a minimum."}
{"id": 163, "input": "In fact, it is only during these periods of low solar activity that very long radio waves from space can pass through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface."}
{"id": 164, "input": "The main goal of the T-shaped radio telescope at Penticton was to produce a map of radio sources in our galaxy."}

{"id": 241, "input": "The instruments on each telescope, however, are not necessarily the same (cameras, spectrometers, etc.). One of the main contributions made by Canada was to provide an adaptive optics system: a system that corrects image distortion due to turbulence in Earth\u2019s atmosphere."}
{"id": 242, "input": "The construction of the dome, the support, the subterranean facilities and the system that controls the rotating part of each telescope was also Canada\u2019s responsibility."}

{"id": 252, "input": "This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been little studied up to this point, mainly because the ozone layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet rays that arrive from space."}
{"id": 253, "input": "It becomes increasingly difficult for a mirror to reflect light at very short wavelengths because the waves tend to \"slide\" between the atoms of the reflecting surface."}
{"id": 254, "input": "X-rays, which are found immediately after ultraviolet rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, have such short wavelengths that they pass right through objects (of course this is also the very property that makes them so useful in medicine)."}

{"id": 264, "input": "It is the product of a collaborative effort between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom."}
{"id": 265, "input": "Neutrinos are small elementary particles that are electrically neutral (that is, they have no electrical charge)."}

{"id": 269, "input": "One of the major unresolved problems about our Sun is related to its production of neutrinos."}
{"id": 270, "input": "In the early 1980\u2019s, it was realized that the number of solar neutrinos detected by various laboratories were less than predicted by theoretical calculations."}
{"id": 271, "input": "Two hypotheses were proposed: either that our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient, or that some of the neutrinos change their form during their voyage to the Earth (this phenomenon is known to affect other elementary particles), which would mean that the number of neutrinos reaching Earth is less than the amount originally emitted by the Sun."}
{"id": 272, "input": "In 1983, Canadian researchers proposed the construction of an underground neutrino detector in an Ontario nickel mine belonging to the company Inco."}
{"id": 273, "input": "The underground site would shield the detector from microwaves in the background cosmic radiation, which would normally impede the detection of solar neutrinos."}
{"id": 274, "input": "One year later, in 1984, an American researcher published a study that demonstrated the advantages of using heavy water (water in which the hydrogen atoms each have an extra neutron) as a neutrino detector."}
{"id": 275, "input": "Since Canada has an abundant reserve of heavy water, it was decided that the facility would operate as a heavy water detector."}
{"id": 276, "input": "The detector consists of 1,000 tonnes of ultra pure heavy water enclosed in a transparent plastic vessel measuring 12 metres across."}

{"id": 279, "input": "The results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have demonstrated that neutrinos do indeed change their form during their trip from the Sun to the Earth, thus putting an end to the debate."}

{"id": 281, "input": "The goal of the Imager is to make a map of the distribution of cosmic background radiation, microwave radiation that represents the aftermath of the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave birth to the Universe."}
{"id": 282, "input": "Mapping the distribution of this ancient light \u2013 this ancient radiation \u2013 effectively allows researchers to \"see\" what the Universe looked like very shortly after its birth."}
{"id": 283, "input": "This information is extremely important because it helps them better understand the creation, organization and evolution of large structures in the cosmos, such as galaxy clusters."}
{"id": 284, "input": "The observatory\u2019s telescope operates at wavelengths between 0.83 and 1.15 centimetres, which corresponds to the field of microwaves."}

{"id": 291, "input": "It is the first international satellite in which Canada played a major role in design, construction and operation."}
{"id": 292, "input": "Its mission is twofold: the first objective focuses on aeronomy (the study of the atmosphere), and the second on astronomy."}
{"id": 293, "input": "The aeronomic goal is to study certain molecules that are found in Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 such as water, chlorine compounds and ozone \u2013 which can help us better understand the processes that cause thinning of the ozone layer."}
{"id": 294, "input": "The goal in terms of astronomy is to detect specific molecules in comets, planets, stars, interstellar clouds and galaxies."}
{"id": 295, "input": "The molecules of greatest interest are water and oxygen, because these cannot be studied from Earth\u2019s surface: our atmosphere blocks any radiation emitted by these molecules in space."}
{"id": 296, "input": "Canada\u2019s role in the project began in 1991 when informal discussions began with Sweden about a possible collaboration between the two countries."}
{"id": 297, "input": "Canada provided several instruments, including OSIRIS, which are used to study specific gases and aerosols in Earth\u2019s atmosphere for the aeronomic part of the mission."}

{"id": 305, "input": "The telescope will complete one orbit around the Earth every 101 minutes by passing over each of Earth\u2019s poles."}
{"id": 306, "input": "The discovery was that Procyon, one of the most studied stars, shows no pulsations at all, which contradicts 20 years of ideas and observations, and forced astronomers to rethink their models for stars."}
{"id": 307, "input": "In 2005, MOST was responsible for another surprising discovery: it observed a giant planet that orbits so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with that of the planet."}
{"id": 308, "input": "Normally, it is the other way around: a planet synchronizes its orbit with that of its host star."}

{"id": 706, "input": "Astronomers \u00ab Return to the instruments The human eye An extraordinary organ The eye is the organ that allows us to see."}
{"id": 707, "input": "Light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina, which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation."}
{"id": 708, "input": "From there, the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve."}
{"id": 709, "input": "The human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina."}
{"id": 710, "input": "The role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea, keeping it at a fairly constant level."}
{"id": 711, "input": "Too much light can damage the retina, whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly."}
{"id": 712, "input": "Its centre, the pupil, allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see."}
{"id": 713, "input": "This is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light (like when the Sun blinds us) to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina, and contracts when there is not enough light (like when we walk into a darkened room) to allow in the most light possible."}
{"id": 714, "input": "It is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina."}
{"id": 715, "input": "The lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light."}
{"id": 716, "input": "On the other hand, they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work."}
{"id": 717, "input": "The rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark."}
{"id": 718, "input": "They are not, however, capable of distinguishing different colours and details, and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim."}

{"id": 723, "input": "A dial on one side, graduated from 0 to 90 degrees, is used to measure the inclination of the telescope."}
{"id": 724, "input": "When the celestial object in question passes through the meridian, the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing."}
{"id": 725, "input": "A map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars, planets, the Moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time."}

{"id": 731, "input": "Astronomers \u00ab Return to the instruments Refracting telescopes Concentrating light by refraction through lenses The Assyrians (people who lived in a region that is known today as Iraq) were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects, possibly around 1,500 BC."}
{"id": 732, "input": "The evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the English archaeologist John Layard in 1850 during the excavation of the ancient city of Nimrud."}
{"id": 733, "input": "The crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens, however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose."}
{"id": 734, "input": "Evidence that lenses were in use during the first century BC can be found in the records of the Roman authors Pliny and Senecio who reported that an engraver at Pompeii used a lens to help him in his work."}
{"id": 735, "input": "Other historical evidence reveals that the Arabs were using lenses by the year 600 AD, as were the Vikings around the year 900."}
{"id": 736, "input": "The first person to do so with certainty, and thus the person to be credited with its invention, was the English mathematician Leonard Digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between 1540 and 1553 to assist with his topographic surveys."}
{"id": 737, "input": "Leonard Digges \u2013 or perhaps his son, the English astronomer Thomas Digges \u2013 was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects."}

{"id": 739, "input": "Lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention, but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence."}
{"id": 740, "input": "The English mathematician Thomas Harriot was the first to study the Moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in 1609, and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before Galileo Galilei, the famous Italian physicist, did the same."}
{"id": 741, "input": "Galilei, however, was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled \"The Starry Messenger\" (translated from Latin)."}
{"id": 742, "input": "The first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube."}
{"id": 743, "input": "The larger of the two is the objective, or primary lens, and the second is the ocular."}
{"id": 744, "input": "The role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point \u2013 the focal point \u2013 so as to obtain a sharper magnified image."}
{"id": 745, "input": "Lenses, to be effective in a telescope, must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point."}
{"id": 746, "input": "Unfortunately, we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens."}
{"id": 747, "input": "Chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens."}
{"id": 748, "input": "A lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere."}
{"id": 749, "input": "Unfortunately, a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point, but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass."}
{"id": 750, "input": "These days, refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations."}
{"id": 751, "input": "Astronomers \u00ab Return to the instruments Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors In contrast to a refracting telescope, which uses lenses to enlarge images, reflecting telescopes (also known as reflectors) use mirrors to accomplish the same goal."}
{"id": 752, "input": "The advantages are numerous: manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses, there are less aberration-related problems, and the main mirror can be supported from below."}
{"id": 753, "input": "Today, the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented."}
{"id": 754, "input": "Sometime between 1540 and 1553, the English mathematician Leonard Digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens."}
{"id": 755, "input": "In 1576, his son Thomas, an astronomer, used it to defend the idea that the Universe is infinite, which was a revolutionary concept at the time."}
{"id": 756, "input": "In 1663, the Scottish mathematician and astronomer James Gregory published his book Optima Promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope."}
{"id": 757, "input": "The English physicist Robert Hooke built the actual instrument several years later, only a short time before Isaac Newton developed his own telescope in 1668."}
{"id": 758, "input": "The primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest."}
{"id": 759, "input": "The secondary mirror, smaller than the primary, is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer."}
{"id": 760, "input": "In 1672, the Catholic priest and French teacher Laurent Cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript."}
{"id": 761, "input": "The Cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror, which collected light from the celestial object, and a secondary mirror, which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror."}
{"id": 762, "input": "The image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope, and not from the side, as with Newton\u2019s design."}
{"id": 763, "input": "Astronomers \u00ab Return to the instruments Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible Refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light."}
{"id": 764, "input": "Although visible light provides valuable information, it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum."}
{"id": 765, "input": "To see the rest of the spectrum, which consists of invisible colours, researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study."}
{"id": 766, "input": "For the infrared domain, the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays."}
{"id": 767, "input": "Because the light being collected is invisible, the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror\u2019s focal point."}
{"id": 768, "input": "One of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere, from any human observers present in the room, and from the telescope itself."}
{"id": 769, "input": "In addition, atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space, which makes data collection difficult \u2013 or even impossible \u2013 at some wavelengths."}
{"id": 770, "input": "To overcome these problems, detectors are cooled to very low temperatures (sometimes down to -269 \u00b0C) and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier."}
{"id": 771, "input": "The great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the Universe is due to its powers of penetration."}
{"id": 772, "input": "Infrared waves are capable of passing through dust, allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light, such as the interiors of nebulas."}
{"id": 773, "input": "At longer wavelengths in the microwave domain, absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites."}
{"id": 774, "input": "In order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope, the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected."}
{"id": 775, "input": "Consequently, it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths, like microwaves; instead, a simple metal dish will suffice."}
{"id": 776, "input": "Cosmic background radiation \u2013 that amazing \"first light\" emitted when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old \u2013 exists mainly in the form of microwaves."}
{"id": 777, "input": "Radio waves, which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves, are typically collected using large metal dishes."}
{"id": 778, "input": "Radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies."}
{"id": 779, "input": "For light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light, like ultraviolet rays, it is possible to use optical telescopes."}
{"id": 780, "input": "Unfortunately for astronomers (but fortunately for human beings), most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching Earth\u2019s surface."}
{"id": 781, "input": "Satellites must also be used to study X-rays and gamma rays, which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays."}
{"id": 782, "input": "These light rays are so energetic, however, that they can easily pass through mirrors; special collectors must be used to detect them."}

{"id": 786, "input": "The invention of photography, which could accurately transfer images to paper, was quickly adopted as a convenient solution."}
{"id": 787, "input": "Once the emulsion is exposed to light, the light-sensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure."}

{"id": 800, "input": "Also in 1850, the English inventor Frederick Scott Archer came up with the wet collodion process."}
{"id": 801, "input": "By producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper, the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger, hence the great interest for astronomers."}

{"id": 805, "input": "Thanks to colour filters, images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours, which greatly increased the public\u2019s interest in astronomy."}
{"id": 806, "input": "Astronomers \u00ab Return to the instruments Filters Blocking some light to reveal more details In 1861, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell created the first colour photograph."}

{"id": 977, "input": "Surprised by this result, he began to suspect that light, electricity and magnetism were one and the same."}
{"id": 978, "input": "To follow up on this idea, he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave \u2013 as demonstrated by Thomas Young more than 50 years earlier \u2013 but an electromagnetic wave."}
{"id": 979, "input": "The discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance."}
{"id": 980, "input": "Maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra, but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea."}
{"id": 981, "input": "Hertz labelled these new waves \"radio waves\", and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio."}
{"id": 982, "input": "Today, the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow, as shown in the diagram below."}
{"id": 983, "input": "The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent."}
{"id": 984, "input": "If the electromagnetic spectrum was a window 30 million kilometres long, we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light."}
{"id": 985, "input": "The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons."}
{"id": 986, "input": "The divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths."}
{"id": 987, "input": "For example, the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect."}
{"id": 988, "input": "Although other electromagnetic waves \u2013 radio waves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays \u2013 represent \"colours\" that are invisible to us, they are nonetheless forms of light."}
